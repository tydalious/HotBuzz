=Hot Buzz Prototype Board=
	The Hot Buzz was designed and fabricated as a prototype project for CMPE 410, Micro-controllers. 
A simple idea, such as reading a temperature, manufactured into a physical device. It might not be able 
to fit in your pocket, but it can certainly follow a “set it and forget it” lifestyle.
